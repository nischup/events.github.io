               <p>
                  Your ticket will be exchanged at the venue entrance for an RFID-enabled wristband which will serve as your digital wallet. The cashless wristband is the only form of payment for purchases for food and drinks at the event.<br>
                  “Top up” stations will be located throughout the event to allow patrons to add additional credits to your wristband.
                  Cashless FAQ  <br>
                  How does the cashless payment system work? <br>
                  •  Upon arrival, you’ll be given a wristband which has a digital chip, in exchange for your ticket.<br>
                  •  Top up your wristband with cash or credit card at the top-up stations around site .  <br>
                  •  Use your wristband as your wallet.  <br>
                  •  What are the benefits of cashless payments?  <br>
                  o  Time-saving and user-friendly  <br>
                  o  No need to carry cash or a credit card  <br>
                  o  Accepted at all bars and food vendors  <br>

                  What if there’s credit left on my wristband when I want to leave?  <br>
                  •  Onsite you are able to top-up as little as SGD $1.00 to help spend off any balances credits.  <br>
                  •  If you have remaining RFID credits post event, simply download iGo eWallet app:  <br>
                  o https://is.gd/igoiosapp – for iOS  <br>
                  o https://is.gd/igoandroidapp – for Android  <br>
                  •  Register your NFC Tag# and information in the app. Balance credits will be available in app once event account settle.  <br>
                  •  You can carry your balance credits forward and apply them for upcoming events and ticket purchases.  <br>
                  •  For withdraw of credits from the ewallet, a S$3.00 handling fee will be applied  <br>

                  What happens if my wristband is damaged?  <br>
                  We highly recommend you don’t tamper with your wristband as you will need it at all times for entry and making purchases. Should your wristband get damaged however, bring it to the ticket help desk (located at the event entrance) <br>

                  Excepted currency forms for Top-up ;$SGD/Credit Card (Visa, Mastercard)
                  The event currency conversion is $1 SGD = 1 Event Dollar.
